WELCOME_DISCLAMER_TITLE=Disclaimer
WELCOME_DISCLAMER_CONTENT=<p>The present ESPD prototype is not an officially deployed ESPD solution yet but serves only as a tool to demonstrate the possibilities of the ESPD service in conjunction with e-Certis. The ESPD service is planned to be ready by the end of this year. Until then it will undergo many implementation cycles. If you have any feedback on the prototype of the ESPD service, please share it by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:grow-espd@ec.europa.eu" target="_top">grow-espd@ec.europa.eu</a>. <p>We recommend you to follow the guidance provided below on the different use cases. For the ease of use, we have added several <label class="fa fa-info-circle tooltip"></label> in the ESPD prototype. As soon as you move your mouse over it, a tooltip will display additional explanatory information.
WELCOME_USECASES_TITLE=Use cases
WELCOME_USECASES_CONTENT=<p>To show you some scenarios on how the ESPD service could be used, we provide you some use cases. <p><b>Use case 1:</b> How an authority can create an ESPD with the ESPD service you can find <a href="">here</a>

filter_header=Selection of entity
filter_alert=<p>Standard form for the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD).<p>The ESPD is a self-declaration provided by economic operators which are asked for a preliminary evidence in a procurement procedure. It replaces the certificates issued by public authorities or third parties. It aims to reduce the administrative burden arising from the requirement to produce a substantial number of certificates or other types of evidence related to exclusion and selection criteria.
filter_who_are_you=Who are you?
filter_i_am_ca=I am a contracting authority
filter_i_am_eop=I am an economic operator

tooltip_espd_used_both_ca_eo=The ESPD service can be used by both contracting authorities and economic operators. Please select the option which corresponds to your profile in this public procurement procedure.
tooltip_filter_eo_can_import_espd=The economic operator can import the ESPD file, which was pre-filled by the contracting authority for this public procurement procedure and published with the tender notice.
tooltip_eo_can_reuse_espd=The economic operator can reuse the information, which was provided via an ESPD in a previous procurement procedure ("old" ESPD). The ESPD service will merge the "old" ESPD with the new form prepared by the contracting authority for this procurement procedure.
tooltip_ca_ref_buyer=The term contracting authority refers to the buyer / tenderer.
tooltip_eo_ref_suppl=The term economic operator refers to the supplier / bidder.

tooltip_ca_can_create_espd=The contracting authority can create an ESPD from scratch. In such a case, the contracting authority has to fill in the ESPD form with all relevant information.
tooltip_ca_can_import_espd=If the contracting authority has already used the ESPD service for another procurement procedure in the past, it can import the ESPD stored on the local network. In this case, the ESPD does not have to be filled in from scratch but some data still needs to be updated to take into account the current procurement procedure. <p>IMPORTANT: This feature does not work in the current prototype. If you select it, the "Next" button will be disabled.
tooltip_overview_received_espds=This feature provides a table with an overview of answers included in all ESPDs provided by the bidders for a given procurement procedure. <p>IMPORTANT: This feature creates only a dummy table in the current prototype (data showed do not correspond to those inserted by the user).
tooltip_review_espd=The contracting authority can check/review the electronic ESPD received from the economic operator.
