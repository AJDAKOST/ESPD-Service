WELCOME_DISCLAMER_TITLE=Disclaimer
WELCOME_DISCLAMER_CONTENT=<p>The present ESPD prototype is not an officially deployed ESPD solution yet but serves only as a tool to demonstrate the possibilities of the ESPD service in conjunction with e-Certis. The ESPD service is planned to be ready by the end of this year. Until then it will undergo many implementation cycles. If you have any feedback on the prototype of the ESPD service, please share it by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:grow-espd@ec.europa.eu" target="_top">grow-espd@ec.europa.eu</a>. <p>We recommend you to follow the guidance provided below on the different use cases. For the ease of use, we have added several  in the ESPD prototype. As soon as you move your mouse over it, a tooltip will display additional explanatory information.
WELCOME_USECASES_TITLE=Use cases
WELCOME_USECASES_CONTENT=<p>To show you some scenarios on how the ESPD service could be used, we provide you some use cases. <p><b>Use case 1:</b> How an authority can create an ESPD with the ESPD service you can find <a href="">here</a>
