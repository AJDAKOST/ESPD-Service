The ESPD service is planned to be ready by the end of this year. Until then it will undergo many implementation cycles. If you have any feedback on the prototype of the ESPD service, please share it by sending an e-mail to <a href='mailto:grow-espd@ec.europa.eu' target='_top'>grow-espd@ec.europa.eu</a>. <p>We recommend you to follow the guidance provided below on the different use cases. For the ease of use, we have added several <label class='fa fa-info-circle tooltip'></label> in the ESPD prototype. As soon as you move your mouse over it, a tooltip will display additional explanatory information.

In this case, the ESPD does not have to be filled in from scratch but some data still needs to be updated to take into account the current procurement procedure. <p>IMPORTANT: This feature does not work in the current prototype. If you select it, the 'Next' button will be disabled.
