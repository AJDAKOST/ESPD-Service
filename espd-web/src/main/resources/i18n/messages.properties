welcome_disclaimer_content=<p>The present ESPD prototype is not an officially deployed ESPD solution yet but serves only as a tool to demonstrate the possibilities of the ESPD service in conjunction with e-Certis. The ESPD service is planned to be ready by the end of this year. Until then it will undergo many implementation cycles. If you have any feedback on the prototype of the ESPD service, please share it by sending an e-mail to <a href='mailto:grow-espd@ec.europa.eu' target='_top'>grow-espd@ec.europa.eu</a>. <p>We recommend you to follow the guidance provided below on the different use cases. For the ease of use, we have added several <label class='fa fa-info-circle tooltip'></label> in the ESPD prototype. As soon as you move your mouse over it, a tooltip will display additional explanatory information.

filter_header=Welcome to the ESPD service
filter_alert=<p>Access of businesses to cross-border tendering procedures is now easier with the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) which has replaced different form sheets used by  EU Members States in the past. The ESPD simplifies the old tendering procedures when all interested parties had to provide full documentary evidence of their suitability, financial status and abilities. Today you just need to fill in the new European Single Procurement Document which is a self-declaration available in all EU languages and used as preliminary evidence that you fulfil all required conditions in public procurement procedures across the EU.<p>Bidders can fill in the information requested in the ESPD directly in an electronic version of the ESPD, provided by the European Commission services free of charge, for buyers, bidders and other interested parties (see below). As long as the information remains correct and continues to be pertinent, bidders may reuse an ESPD provided in a previous public procurement procedure.<p>Bidders may fill in the online form and print it and then send it to the buyer together with its bid. If the procedure is run electronically, the service allows for exporting and storing the ESPD, which would be submitted electronically together with the bid. From October 2018 the ESPD shall be provided exclusively in an electronic form.<p>Bidders may be excluded from the procurement procedure or be subject to prosecution under national law in cases of serious misrepresentation in filling in the ESPD or, generally, in supplying the information required for the verification of the absence of grounds for exclusion or the fulfilment of the selection criteria, or where such information is withheld or the economic operators are unable to submit the supporting documents.
