This is a short documentation of the ESPD files that you find in this ZIP folder.

espd.XML: The XML file is a file that our ESPD service or other compatible ESPD services can understand.
The advantage of using the eESPD as a XML file is that buyers and companies can reuse it for other procedures in the future.
It should be sent together with the procurement documents (from authority to companies) or as part of the bid (company to authority).

espd.PDF: The PDF file is a human readable file of the eESPD. We suggest here as well that it is used alongside the XML
format with the procurement documents (from authority to companies) or as part of the bid (company to authority) as a reference document.

If you have questions about the files please do not hesitate to get in contact with us through
the following email address: grow-espd@ec.europa.eu.
